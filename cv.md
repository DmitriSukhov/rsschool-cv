### 3. About me

Just a story.  
Since 2014, I began to study HTML markup, CSS styles and typesetting simple pages, I was interested in it back then, a long time ago ... But it wasn’t a simple training at the university, and the work took all the time, the successes were tiny. But I didn’t after 5 years (horror, as much as 5 years passed) I did not stop dreaming of better times when I will start devoting my time to website development, and do it with a creative approach.
Now I’m incredibly close to accomplishing an idea, I’ve been tempted to study, I haven’t been giving up and have been idle since June, every day I read and try to write something. Now is the best time for me to achieve a result. If I don’t pass this set, I’ll come to the next one, buy books, watch video courses at ITVDN, I will do everything to achieve my goal.

<span style="color:peru">London - the Capital of Great Britain...</span>    
<span style="color:indigo">I study English using mobile applications, I try to read all TK and google in English, I specially went through the Code Academy - because everything is in English there. I read the book "Martian" in the original.
I can discuss some topics, I don’t always understand it by ear, and today, honestly, I don’t have a rich vocobulary. But I am working on it.</span>
